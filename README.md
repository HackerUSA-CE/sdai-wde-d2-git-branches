# Lab 1: Understanding Git Branches and Creating Initial Wireframe

---

## Activity Title - Build the Initial Wireframe

---

## Description ðŸ“„
This lab will guide you through creating an initial wireframe for a webpage using HTML and Git branches. You'll create branches for each part of the wireframe.

---

## Acceptance Criteria ðŸ“‹
1. **Create a repository:** Initialize a new Git repository and upload it to GitHub.
2. **Main branch:** Set up the main branch with the basic structure.
3. **Feature branch:** Create a separate branch for the header.
4. **HTML structure:** Each branch should contain the corresponding HTML structure.

---

## ToDo list âœ…
**Attention**: When you complete a task, put an `x` in the middle of the brackets to mark it off your ToDo list.

- [ ] Initialize a new Git repository:
  1. Open your terminal or Git Bash.
  2. Using command line, navigate to where you want your repo to reside, then use `mkdir project-name` with the project name of your choice.
   
   **All repository names must be a folder or directory with a title that only has lowercase letters and dashes between words**

  3. Using `cd`, go into the directory you just made.
  4. Initialize a new Git repository: `git init`.
  5. Create a README file: `echo "# Project Title" >> README.md`.
  6. Add the README file to staging: `git add README.md`.
  7. Commit the README file: `git commit -m "Initial commit with README"`.
- [ ] Fork a new repository on GitHub:
  1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
  2. Click the "New" button to create a new repository.
  3. Enter a repository name and description.
  4. Choose the "Public" option.
  5. Do not initialize with a README (you already have one).
  6. Click "Create repository".
- [ ] Push your local repository to GitHub:
  1. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to push an existing repository from the command line:
     ```
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```
- [ ] Create and switch to the `main` branch:
  1. Ensure you are on the `main` branch: `git checkout main`.
- [ ] Create a basic HTML file (`index.html`) with the doctype and root elements:
  1. Create `index.html` in your project directory.
  2. Add the boilerplate HTML structure using the `!` cheat. 
  3. Add and commit the changes: `git add index.html`, `git commit -m "Added basic HTML structure"`.
  4. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push origin main`.
- [ ] Create a branch for the header section:
  1. Create and switch to the `header` branch: `git checkout -b header`.
  2. Add a header element to `index.html` on the `header` branch: 
  3. Add and commit the changes: `git add index.html`, `git commit -m "Added header"`.
  4. Push the changes to GitHub: `git push origin header`.
- [ ] Check your GitHub repository on the site. You should a button that says `Compare & pull request`. 
![Compare & Pull Request button](/assets/images/prs-github.png)
- [ ] Click the button. 
- [ ] Now look at the image below of opening a pull request, there are things you need to check before you click. 
![Pull request page](/assets/images/create-pr.png)
  1. **Red box** - the `main` branch should be compared with the `feature-header` branch. 
  2. **White box** - Lets you know if this is able to be merged with the `main` branch. 
  3. **Green box** - Write any notes you want to keep.
  4. **Purple box** - Click the pull request button when you have passed the checks above. 
- [ ] Now you have the `Merge pull request` page. 
![Merge PR page](/assets/images/merge-pr.png)
  1. **Red box** - Make sure the branch doesn't contain conflicts. 
  2. **Blue box** - **Click the button** to merge your PR and **close** the request at the bottom.


ðŸŽŠ **Fantastic work! You just finished your first of many many pull requests (PRs).** ðŸŽŠ

**ðŸ›‘ Do not do anything else from this point as this is the first part ðŸ›‘**
